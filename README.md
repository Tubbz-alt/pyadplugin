pyadplugin
==========
Small module to quickly deploy and test image processing code in python before converting the code to a real areaDetector plugin. This relies on klauer/pypvserver to simplify the implementation and avoid using pcaspy directly. This was a quick one-day project, so there are likely to be some bugs.
